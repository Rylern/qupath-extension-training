# QuPath Training Extension

This is a QuPath extension to help users learn how to use the software.

It's still in its early stages...

Currently, it adds a 'User interface tour' under the 'Help' menu.

## Installing

To install the training extension, you can:
* Open the QuPath [extension manager](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/extensions.html#managing-extensions-with-the-extension-manager) and install the extension from there (recommended).
* Or download the latest `qupath-extension-training-[version].jar` file from [releases](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-training/releases) and drag it onto the main QuPath window.

If you haven't installed any extensions before, you'll be prompted to select a QuPath user directory.
The extension will then be copied to a location inside that directory.

You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).
